# Configuration for Faction Power

# The starting power for a newly created faction.
default-power: 10

# The maximum power a faction can accumulate.
max-power: 100

# The amount of power required for each chunk a faction claims.
# For example, if set to 5, a faction needs 50 power to hold 10 chunks.
power-per-claim: 5

# Power changes from player interactions
player-interactions:
  # Power lost when a faction member dies.
  on-death: -3
  # Power gained by the killer's faction when they kill a member of another faction.
  on-kill: 2

# Power changes from PvE events

# --- Faction Raiding ---
raiding:
  # A faction becomes raidable if its power drops below the total power of its claimed land.
  # For example, with power-per-claim at 5, a faction with 10 chunks (50 power value) is raidable if its power is 49 or less.
  # You can add a buffer here. A value of -10 means a faction is safe until its power is 10 below its land value.
  raidable-power-buffer: -10

  # How long a faction remains raidable after its power drops too low (in minutes).
  raid-window-minutes: 60
